# weather-app

# Desription 
this app was built to test my knoledge of javascript using server side apis to fetch data from another server and take that data and have it appear on my screen. the app is a weather application that allows us to type in any city we would like to know the weather of for the current day and the next 5 days and have it appear and after clicking the button again with a new city in mind the current data will be removed and new data will appear. when building this app i was very lost at first on where to start then i remembered the internet is at our grasp for information when needed. from there i did research and decided where i would start and just start building down from there. i got the basic webpage build with html then did the styling with css then for javascript. the java script was the most challenging for me and took the longest to put together because i was first having troubles getting the api keys to work then figuring out where i put the api key and how to use if then statments and using json. after following about 5 different youtube videos and reading many posts about challanges very similar to this i finally achieved my final product.

# how to use
to use this app you will need to have access to my git hub profile and will have to follow the link in my read me file or on the webpage and follow it to the destination. from there you just put in the city name you want information for and press enter.
